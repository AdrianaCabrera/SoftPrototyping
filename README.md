# SoftPrototyping
'Soft Prototyping' is a term that refers the making, hacking, and fabrication of projects that demand flexibility, enabling an innovative way of communication and interaction. Digital fabrication has been increasing the boundaries of how and why we are manufacturing, working on a small scale, but in a high level of complexity. This development includes not only the use of the machines but also an in-depth study of the materials as paper, textiles, bio-materials, electronics, and their applications, that can be explored from a communication design perspective.
